# Capstone EDA Project Housing Data Analysis

## Project Summary :

This is an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) project that focuses on exploring and analyzing a housing dataset. The dataset used in this project consists of various attributes related to housing properties, such as location, size, number of rooms, and prices.


## About Dataset :

The housing dataset used in this project contains information about different housing properties. 
#### The dataset includes the following columns:

* longitude: The longitude coordinates of the property's location.
* latitude: The latitude coordinates of the property's location.
* housing_median_age: The median age of houses in the property's neighborhood.
* total_rooms: The total number of rooms in the property.
* total_bedrooms: The total number of bedrooms in the property.
* population: The total population in the property's neighborhood.
* households: The total number of households in the property's neighborhood.
* median_income: The median income of households in the property's neighborhood.
* median_house_value: The median value of owner-occupied homes in the property's neighborhood.
* ocean_proximity: The proximity of the property to the ocean or other bodies of water.

## Different Python libraries used to complete this EDA :

* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib.Pyplot
* Seaborn
